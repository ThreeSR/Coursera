    "### Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to implement a GAN controllability method using gradients from a classifier. By training a classifier to recognize a relevant feature, you can use it to change the generator's inputs (z-vectors) to make it generate images with more or less of that feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be started you off with a pre-trained generator and classifier, so that you can focus on the controllability aspects. However, in case you would like to train your own classifier, the code for that has been provided as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1. Observe how controllability can change a generator's output.\n",
    "2. Resolve some of the challenges that entangled features pose to controllability."

You use stochastic gradient ascent to find the local maxima, as opposed to stochastic gradient descent which finds the local minima. Gradient ascent is gradient descent over the negative of the value being optimized. Their formulas are essentially the same, however, instead of subtracting the weighted value, stochastic gradient ascent adds it; it can be calculated by `new = old + (∇ old * weight)`, where ∇ is the gradient of `old`. You perform stochastic gradient ascent to try and maximize the amount of the feature you want. If you wanted to reduce the amount of the feature, you would perform gradient descent. However, in this assignment you are interested in maximize your feature using gradient ascent, since many features in the dataset are not present much more often than they're present and you are trying to add a feature to the images, not remove.\n",

To fix this, you can try to isolate the target feature more by holding the classes outside of the target class constant. One way you can implement this is by penalizing the differences from the original class with L2 regularization. This L2 regularization would apply a penalty for this difference using the L2 norm and this would just be an additional term on the loss function.\n",
