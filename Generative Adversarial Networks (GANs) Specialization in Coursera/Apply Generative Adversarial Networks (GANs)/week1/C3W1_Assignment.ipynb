    "### Goals\n",
    "In this notebook you're going to build a generator that can be used to help create data to train a classifier. There are many cases where this might be useful. If you are interested in any of these topics, you are welcome to explore the linked papers and articles! \n",
    "\n",
    "-   With smaller datasets, GANs can provide useful data augmentation that substantially [improve classifier performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04340). \n",
    "-   You have one type of data already labeled and would like to make predictions on [another related dataset for which you have no labels](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52737-x). (You'll learn about the techniques for this use case in future notebooks!)\n",
    "-   You want to protect the privacy of the people who provided their information so you can provide access to a [generator instead of real data](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.005122). \n",
    "-   You have [input data with many missing values](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02920), where the input dimensions are correlated and you would like to train a model on complete inputs. \n",
    "-   You would like to be able to identify a real-world abnormal feature in an image [for the purpose of diagnosis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-00946-5_11), but have limited access to real examples of the condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you're going to be acting as a bug enthusiast — more on that later. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.   Understand some use cases for data augmentation and why GANs suit this task.\n",
    "2.   Implement a classifier that takes a mixed dataset of reals/fakes and analyze its accuracy."

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Augmentation\n",
    "Before you implement GAN-based data augmentation, you should know a bit about data augmentation in general, specifically for image datasets. It is [very common practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04621) to augment image-based datasets in ways that are appropriate for a given dataset. This may include having your dataloader randomly flipping images across their vertical axis, randomly cropping your image to a particular size, randomly adding a bit of noise or color to an image in ways that are true-to-life. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, data augmentation helps to stop your model from overfitting to the data, and allows you to make small datasets many times larger. However, a sufficiently powerful classifier often still overfits to the original examples which is why GANs are particularly useful here. They can generate new images instead of simply modifying existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CIFAR\n",
    "The [CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/learning-features-2009-TR.pdf) datasets are extremely widely used within machine learning -- they contain many thousands of “tiny” 32x32 color images of different classes representing relatively common real-world objects like airplanes and dogs, with 10 classes in CIFAR-10 and 100 classes in CIFAR-100. In CIFAR-100, there are 20 “superclasses” which each contain five classes. For example, the “fish” superclass contains “aquarium fish, flatfish, ray, shark, trout”. For the purposes of this assignment, you’ll be looking at a small subset of these images to simulate a small data regime, with only 40 images of each class for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tbrqp8-NJ59VBpS5T_ibrQzEpgtZ3suw)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializations\n",
    "You will begin by importing some useful libraries and packages and defining a visualization function that has been provided. You will also be re-using your conditional generator and functions code from earlier assignments. This will let you control what class of images to augment for your classifier."

    "\n",
    "But the bug classes don't do as well as you would like. Now your plan is to train a GAN on the same data so it can generate new bugs to make your classifier better at distinguishing between all of your favorite bugs!\n",
    "\n",
    "You will fine-tune your model by augmenting the original real data with fake data and during that process, observe how to increase the accuracy of your classifier with these fake, GAN-generated bugs. After this, you will prove your worth as a bug master."

    "Suppose that you've decided that although you have this pre-trained general generator and this general classifier, capable of identifying 100 classes with some accuracy (~17%), what you'd really like is a model that can classify the five different kinds of bugs in the dataset. You'll fine-tune your model by augmenting your data with the generated images. Keep in mind that both the generator and the classifier were trained on the same images: the 40 images per class you painstakingly found so your generator may not be great. This is the caveat with data augmentation, ultimately you are still bound by the real data that you have but you want to try and create more. To make your models even better, you would need to take some more bug photos, label them, and add them to your training set and/or use higher quality photos.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, you'll first need to write some code to sample a combination of real and generated images. Given a probability, `p_real`, you'll need to generate a combined tensor where roughly `p_real` of the returned images are sampled from the real images. Note that you should not interpolate the images here: you should choose each image from the real or fake set with a given probability. For example, if your real images are a tensor of `[[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]` and your fake images are a tensor of `[[-1, -2, -3, -4, -5]]`, and `p_real = 0.2`, two potential return values are `[[1, -2, 3, -4, -5]]` or `[[-1, 2, -3, -4, -5]]`\n",
