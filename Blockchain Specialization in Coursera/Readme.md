# Welcome to this specialization!

You can find some files you need to submit when you learn these courses. Apart from these files, you may find it helpful after clicking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgiiwQvT2BA 

**Notice: You are supposed to manage to accomplish homework by yourself at beginning, then you can check or refer your answers here. I don't recommend you copy answers at first.** 

I hope you can have fun learning in *Coursera*.
